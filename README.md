# Big-Arithmetics
Arithmetic functions with arguments bigger than basic data types in mind.
Currently supporting addition and subtraction for any natural number comprising N digits. Tests for these functions are also provided. 
Any time now division and multiplication should be implemented too. Hopefully, after that, the implementation will expand to support decimals and negative numbers. Who knows, maybe it will even become somewhat efficient.
